  - name: int_daily_action_decomposition
    description: >
      Tracks the daily flow of actions for each medical_group-plan-date combination,
      decomposing available actions into: completed, no longer eligible, and net changes;
      provides quality flags and weekday/weekend classification.

  - name: int_medical_group_action_decomposition_daily
    description: >
      Daily-level decomposition of action inventory for each medical group, 
      aggregating across plans. This model quantifies daily changes in 
      available actions as a result of 1) actions completed, 2) actions that 
      became ineligible, and 3) net new actions introduced.

      - name: actions_start_of_day
        description: >
          Total actions available at the start of the day across all plans.
          Derived via lag function or set to current day's count if no lag.

      - name: actions_end_of_day
        description: >
          Raw count of actions available at the end of the day across all plans.

      - name: daily_net_change_of_actions
        description: >
          Net change = end_of_day - start_of_day. Positive value indicates 
          net new actions introduced.

      - name: count_actions_completed_in_day
        description: >
          Number of actions attested as complete by users on a given day across all plans.

      - name: cumulative_actions_completed
        description: >
          Cumulative sum of actions completed to date, reintegrated from plan-level model.

      - name: count_actions_became_ineligible_in_day
        description: >
          Daily estimate of actions that became ineligible or expired.
          Calculated as difference between available actions no longer observed at end of day 
          not accounted for by completions.

      - name: cumulative_actions_became_ineligible
        description: >
          Running total of lost opportunities due to ineligible actions per medical group.

      - name: daily_net_new_available_actions
        description: >
          Number of new actions added that day, after accounting for 
          completions and expirations. Helps understand proactive program expansion.

      - name: decomposition_balance_check
        description: >
          Data quality flag: TRUE if actions_start_of_day - actions_end_of_day 
          equals (completed + ineligible).

      - name: is_weekend
        description: >
          Boolean flag identifying weekends (Saturday or Sunday), useful for workflow pattern analysis.
